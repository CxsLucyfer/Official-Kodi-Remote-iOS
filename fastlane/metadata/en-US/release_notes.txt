Using Global Search:
"Global Search" lists all movies, movie sets, TV shows, music videos, artists, albums and songs. You can search, sort and continue to browse the database from there. Depending on the size of your database the synchronization can take a while.

Selecting a default view:
A default view can be selected in the app settings. You can for example make the remote your default screen which is brought up automatically after the Kodi server is connected. If the selected view is not configured to be shown in the main menu, the app will show the main menu.

Send Wake-On-LAN automatically:
If the option is enabled in the settings, the App will send Wake-On-LAN when attempting to connect a server. This either happens automatically at startup, or when manually selecting a new server. The option is disabled by default.

Selecting "Prefer post for TV":
To change the setting "Prefer poster for TV shows" go to app settings. This is now an App wide setting.

Cache refresh policy:
Since version 1.10 the library and image cache will be forced to update with each new App version. This ensures the cache holds the data in the expected format and avoids UI glitches.

Connection Timeout:
When observing "Connection Timeout" after upgrading your iOS to 14 or higher please either once use "Find Kodi" or tap a server to re-connect. You should at least once see the "Local Network Privacy Alert" popup and allow the access. For App versions before 1.9 only "Find Kodi" will trigger this.
