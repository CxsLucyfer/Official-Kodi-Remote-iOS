Bugfixes:
- Fix reduced resolution for thumbnails
- Fix 1-movie-sets for Kodi 15 and earlier
- Fix non-visible default values in settings
- Further bugfixes and stability improvements

Remark:
Movie-set behaviour was changed with Remote App 1.8. You need to configure Kodi server to either show or ignore movie sets with only a single movie. This as well can be done in the Remote App via the settings menu (Media / Videos / Include sets containing a single movie). For Kodi versions 15 and earlier this setting is not available, the Remote App will show all movie sets.
